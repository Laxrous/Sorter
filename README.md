# Sorter 
Import a list of items to sort to create a ranking of which items you liked best. Sort through them by picking which one you like more, Left or Right.

Sorting code from [biasorter.tumblr.com](https://biasorter.tumblr.com). I wanted to sort through my music library (1500 songs) and it was taking forever so I made it able to save your progress.
